# Diabetes Prediction with R

## Project Description
This project aims to perform predictive analysis on a diabetes dataset using the R programming language. By applying various machine learning algorithms, we aim to develop a model that can predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on certain features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about several health factors, such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and age, among others, for a group of individuals. The dataset includes both the input features and the corresponding diabetes diagnosis (0 - non-diabetic, 1 - diabetic).

## installation
Ensure that R and the required packages are installed. You can install the necessary packages using the following command in the R console:
```R
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "caret", "randomForest"))
**Usage**
Start R or an R development environment (e.g., RStudio).

Load the dataset into your R environment. Ensure that the dataset file (diabetes.csv) is in the same directory as your R script.

Run the R script (diabetes_prediction.R) to perform the predictive analysis. This script includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions on new data.
